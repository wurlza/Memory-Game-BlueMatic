# Memory Game - BlueMatic Technical Assessment

## Build Overview

This is an interactive HTML5 memory game built for programmatic display placements. The game features a tile-matching mechanic with smooth animations, performance optimizations, and accessibility features.

### Notable Decisions

1. **Pure HTML/CSS/JS Implementation**: No external libraries to keep the bundle size minimal
2. **CSS Grid for Layout**: Provides responsive tile arrangement across different ad sizes
3. **CSS Transforms for Animations**: Hardware-accelerated flip animations for smooth performance
4. **Accessibility Features**: Keyboard navigation, focus indicators, and semantic HTML
5. **Modular Game State**: Centralized state management for clean code structure
